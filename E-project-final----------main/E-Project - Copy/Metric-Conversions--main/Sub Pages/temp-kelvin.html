        <p>
            Kelvin is used worldwide, particularly in science. It is part of the International System of Units (SI) and
            is the fundamental unit for measuring temperature.

            Kelvin is often used with other SI units, such as the Pascal for pressure and the Joule for energy.

            Definition:

            Kelvin is based on the Celsius scale, with the same interval for each degree. However, the start of the
            Kelvin scale is at absolute zero which is -273.15 degrees C. Kelvin is useful in physics, chemistry, and
            cosmology.

            An advantage of using Kelvin is that there are no negative temperatures. This makes temperature
            differentials and calculations easier.

            Origin:

            The Kelvin scale was named after the Scottish physicist William Thomson (lord Kelvin) who made significant
            contributions to thermodynamics and the study of heat and energy.

            Lord Kelvin's work on absolute zero led to the development of this scale. It is based on the idea that
            temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Absolute
            zero is the point where the substance has no kinetic energy and all molecular motion ceases.

            The Kelvin scale is almost exclusively used in science and engineering, particularly in fields such as
            physics, chemistry, and thermodynamics.

            Common references:

            Absolute Zero, 0K

            Melting point of ice, 273.15K

            Warm summer's day in a temperate climate, 295K

            Normal human body temperature, 310K

            Boiling point of water at 1 atmosphere, 373.15K

            Usage context:

            Kelvin is a unit of measurement used in thermodynamics and temperature.

            The Kelvin is almost exclusively used in scientific and engineering contexts such as physics, chemistry and
            cosmology.

            Why can't you get a negative Kelvin value?:

            Kelvin is an absolute measurement of temperature meaning it starts at absolute zero, the lowest possible
            temperature in our universe. Absolute zero is 0 Kelvin(K) or -273.15 degrees Celsius(°C). The Kelvin scale
            is based on the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.

            You cannot have a negative Kelvin value because at 0K there is no kinetic energy in the particles and are at
            their lowest possible state of motion. It is impossible for a system to have less energy than zero.

            Negative Kelvin would imply that a system has a negative thermal energy which breaks the principles of
            thermodynamics. It is important to remember that negative temperatures exist in other temperature scales
            such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit.

            Why is Kelvin quoted as K and not °K?:

            This abbreviation of K is based on the fact that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale where zero Kelvin
            (0K) is absolute zero. Celsius and Fahrenheit which have arbitrary zero points based on freezing and boiling
            points of water are relative and have degrees of relation whereas the Kelvin scale is based on the absolute
            thermodynamic temperature.

            By omitting the degree symbol, it reminds us that Kelvin is not a relative measurement but a unit of
            measurement on its own. The use of "K" instead of "°K" for Kelvin was decided as an SI convention to reserve
            the degree symbol for relative temperature scales.

            What happens at absolute zero (0K)?:

            At absolute zero, 0 Kelvin (0K) or -273.15 degrees Celsius, the temperature is at the lowest possible point
            anything can possibly be. At this temperature the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules is zero causing them
            to come to a complete standstill. All molecular motion ceases and matter becomes still.

            Several amazing phenomena occur here. As there is no molecular motion there is no heat energy and this has
            significant implications for the physical properties of the substance. For example, materials become very
            brittle and their electrical resistance becomes zero. Gases and liquids freeze into solids.

            Scientists have never cooled anything down to absolute zero. However they have been able to see the effects
            of approaching absolute zero. This has provided insights into the behavior of matter and have led to the
            understanding of superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates.
