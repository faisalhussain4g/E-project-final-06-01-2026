            The Celsius scale, already widely used in Europe, replaced the Fahrenheit scale in most countries during the
            mid-to-late 20th century, although Fahrenheit remains the official scale of the United States, Cayman
            Islands

            Definition:

            Although initially defined by the freezing point of water (and later the melting point of ice), the Celsius
            scale is now officially a derived scale, defined in relation to the Kelvin temperature scale.

            Zero on the Celsius scale (0℃) is now defined as the equivalent to 273.15K, with a temperature difference of
            1 deg C equivalent to a difference of 1K, meaning the unit size in each scale is the same. This means that
            100℃, previously defined as the boiling point of water, is now defined as the equivalent to 373.15K.

            The Celsius scale is an interval system but not a ratio system, meaning it follows a relative scale but not
            an absolute scale. This can be seen because the temperature interval between 20℃ and 30℃ is the same as
            between 30℃ and 40℃, but 40℃ does not have twice the air heat energy of 20℃.

            A temperature difference of 1 deg C is the equivalent of a temperature difference 1.8°F.

            Origin:

            The Celsius scale is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744). In 1742, Celsius created
            a temperature scale wherein 0 degrees was the boiling point of water and 100 degrees the freezing point.

            Around this time other physicists independently developed a similar scale but reversed, such that 0 degrees
            was the melting point of ice and 100 degrees the boiling point of water. This new ‘forward’ scale was widely
            adopted across continental Europe, generally being referred to as the centigrade scale.

            The scale was officially named as ‘The Celsius scale’ in 1948 to prevent confusion with the use of
            centigrade as an angular measurement.

            Common references:

            Absolute Zero, -273.15℃

            Melting point of ice, 0℃ (actually -0.0001℃)

            Warm summer's day in a temperate climate, 22℃

            Normal human body temperature, 37℃

            Boiling point of water at 1 atmosphere, 99.9839℃

            Usage context:

            The Celsius scale, already widely used in Europe, replaced the Fahrenheit scale in most countries during the
            mid-to-late 20th century, although Fahrenheit remains the official scale of the United States, Cayman
            Islands

            Why can you not go below -273.15°C?:

            The temperature -273.15°C is known as absolute zero and it is the lowest possible temperature that can exist
            in the universe. At this point all molecular motion ceases and no further fall in temperature is possible
            since the kinetic energy of particles is at zero and they come to a complete standstill.

            The Kelvin and Rankine scales start at absolute zero.

            Going below -273.15°C or 0K is impossible because it contradicts the laws of thermodynamics. The energy of
            particles in an object decreases as they lose kinetic energy and their ability to move. At absolute zero the
            particles have no energy to give up making any further fall in temperature impossible as this would require
            them to have negative energy which is not possible.
