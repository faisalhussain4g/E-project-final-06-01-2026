        <p>Metric tons, also known as tonnes, are widely used as a unit of measurement across the globe. This unit is
            particularly popular in industries such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and transportation. The
            metric ton is well-suited for measuring large quantities, making it ideal for bulk goods such as grains,
            ores, and chemicals.

            The widespread use of metric tons also stems from its compatibility with international trade agreements and
            regulations. Many international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,
            promote the use of the metric system to facilitate global commerce. By adopting metric tons as a standard
            unit, countries can ensure consistency and avoid confusion when conducting business with partners from
            different regions.

            Definition:

            A metric ton, also known as a tonne, is a unit of measurement commonly used in the metric system to quantify
            mass or weight. It is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or approximately 2,204.62 pounds. The term "tonne" is
            derived from the French word "tonne," which means a large cask or barrel.

            Origin:

            The origin of the metric ton, also known as the tonne, can be traced back to the development of the metric
            system in the late 18th century. The metric system was created to establish a universal and standardized
            system of measurement that could be used across different countries and industries. One of the key
            objectives was to simplify conversions between different units of measurement. The metric ton was introduced
            as a unit of mass in the metric system to replace the various ton units used in different countries. It was
            defined as 1,000 kilograms or 1 megagram (Mg). The prefix "kilo-" denotes a factor of 1,000, making the
            metric ton a convenient unit for measuring large masses.

            The adoption of the metric ton has been widespread, particularly in countries that have adopted the metric
            system. It is commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture, where
            large quantities of goods or materials need to be measured. The metric ton is also used in international
            trade to ensure consistency and facilitate communication between different countries.

            Common references:

            Weight of a fully grown elephant is around 1 tonne

            Weight of a double decker bus is between 12 to 16 tonnes

            Usage context:

            Metric tons, also known as tonnes, are a widely used unit of measurement in various industries and sectors
            around the world. It is used in agriculture, particularly when measuring crop yields or livestock
            production. Farmers and agricultural experts often use metric tons to quantify the amount of grain, fruits,
            vegetables, or meat produced. This helps in assessing productivity, planning for storage and transportation,
            and determining market value.

            Another common reference for metric tons is in the shipping and logistics industry. When it comes to
            transporting goods, especially bulk commodities like coal, oil, or minerals, metric tons are the preferred
            unit of measurement. Shipping companies, freight forwarders, and port authorities use metric tons to
            calculate cargo capacity, determine shipping rates, and ensure compliance with weight restrictions. This
            standardization allows for efficient and accurate handling of goods, ensuring smooth operations and
            minimizing risks associated with overloading or underutilization of cargo space.</p>
